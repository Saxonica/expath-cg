TODO: Create a checklist when adding a new module (for the specs, the
website, etc.), and a checklist when publishing a new draft (write an
announce, a news entry, add to specs/list.xml, etc.)  Sketch below, to
improve...

Add a new spec
--------------

Simple answer: copy a simple one, like the HTTP Model, or `http` spec,
and adapt it to your needs.  You can find more details on the wiki, on
the following pages:

- [Process](https://www.w3.org/community/expath/wiki/Process)
- [Naming](https://www.w3.org/community/expath/wiki/Naming)
- [Tests](https://www.w3.org/community/expath/wiki/Tests)
- [Editors](https://www.w3.org/community/expath/wiki/Editors)

**Checklist**:

- ...
- update the [Modules](https://www.w3.org/community/expath/wiki/Modules) page on the wiki

Publish a new version
---------------------

It is possible to an editor to edit a spec and create a pull request.
The current state of a spec is available as an *editor draft*, at a
URL ending with `/editor`, e.g. http://expath.org/spec/http/editor.

In order to publish a new version, either a dated working draft or a
final 1.0 report, you need to update `list.xml`.  Please ask Florent
first, if this is the first time you do it.
