        This proposal provides an HTTP client interface for XPath 2.0.  It
        defines one extension function to perform HTTP requests, and has been
        designed to be compatible with XQuery 1.0 and XSLT 2.0, as well as any
        other XPath 2.0 usage.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section>
	<h3>Namespace conventions</h3>
        <p>The module defined by this document does define one function in the namespace
          <code>http://expath.org/ns/http-client</code>. In this document, the
          <code>http</code> prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.</p>
        <p>Error codes are defined in the namespace <code>http://expath.org/ns/error</code>. In this
          document, the <code>err</code> prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Error management</h3>
        <p>Error conditions are identified by a code (a <code>QName</code>). When such an error
          condition is reached during the execution of the function, a dynamic error is thrown, with
          the corresponding error code (as if the standard XPath function
          <code>error</code> had been called).</p>
        <p>Error codes are defined through the spec. For too many reasons to enumerate here, the
          HTTP protocol layer can raise an error. In this case, if the error condition is not
          mentioned explicitly in the spec, the implementation must raise an error with an
          appropriate message <a href="#dfn-errHC001">err:HC001</a>.</p>

      <h2>The <dfn>http:send-request</dfn> function</h2>
      <p>This module defines an XPath extension function that sends an HTTP request and return the
        corresponding response. It supports HTTP multi-part messages. Here is the signature of this
        function:</p>
      <div class="proto">
        <table class="proto">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="3"><code class="function">http:send-request</code>(</td>
              <td><code class="arg">$request</code></td>
              <td><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">element(http:request)?</code>,</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="arg">$href</code></td>
              <td><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">xs:string?</code>,</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="arg">$bodies</code></td>
              <td><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">item()*</code>)<code class="as"> as </code><code class="return-type">item()+</code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><code>$request</code> contains the various parameters of the request, for instance the
          HTTP method to use or the HTTP headers. Among other things, it can also contain the other
          param's values: the URI and the bodies. If they are not set as parameter to the function,
          their value in $request, if any, is used instead. See the following section for the
          detailed definition of the http:request element. If the parameter does not follow the
          grammar defined in this spec, this is an error <a href="#dfn-errHC005">err:HC005</a>.</li>
        <li><code>$href</code> is the HTTP or HTTPS URI to send the request to. It is an xs:anyURI,
          but is declared as a string to be able to pass literal strings (without requiring to
          explicitly cast it to an xs:anyURI).</li>
        <li><code>$bodies</code> is the request body content, for HTTP methods that can contain a
          body in the request (e.g. POST). This is an error if this param is not the empty sequence
          for methods that must be empty (e.g. DELETE). The details of the methods are defined in
          their respective specs (e.g. [[!rfc2616]] or [[!rfc4918]]). In case of a multipart
          request, it can be a sequence of several items, each one is the body of the corresponding
          body descriptor in
          <code>$request</code>. See below for details.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides the 3-params signature above, there are 2 other signatures that are convenient
        shortcuts (corresponding to the full version in which corresponding params have been set
        to the empty sequence). They are:</p>
      <div class="proto">
        <code class="function">http:send-request</code>(<code class="arg">$request</code><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">element(http:request)?</code>, <code class="arg">$href</code><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">xs:string?</code>) as <code class="return-type">item()+</code>
      </div>
      <div class="proto">
        <code class="function">http:send-request</code>(<code class="arg">$request</code><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">element(http:request)?</code>, <code class="arg">$href</code>) as <code class="return-type">item()+</code>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sending a request</h2>
      <p>The functions defined in this module make one able to send a request to an HTTP server and
        receive the corresponding response.  Here is how the request is represented by the
        parameters to this function, and how they are used to generate the actual HTTP request to
        send.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>The request elements</h3>
        <p>The <code>http:request</code> element represents all the needed information to send the
          HTTP request.  So it is always possible to create such an element that will carry over all
          the needed info for a particular request.  For some of those values though, you can use an
          additional param instead.  For instance, some signatures define the
          parameter <code>$href</code>.  If the value of this parameter is not the empty sequence,
          it will then be used instead of the value of the attribute <code>href</code> on
          the <code>http:request</code> element.</p>

        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:request method = ncname
              href? = uri
              http-version? = string
              status-only? = boolean
              username? = string
              password? = string
              auth-method? = string
              send-authorization? = boolean
              override-media-type? = string
              follow-redirect? = boolean
              timeout? = integer>
   &lt;!-- Content: (http:header*, (http:body|http:multipart)?) -->
&lt;/http:request></pre>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li><code>method</code> is the HTTP verb to use, as GET, POST, etc.  It is case
            insensitive</li>
          <li><code>href</code> is the URI the request has to be sent to.  It can be overridden by
            the parameter <code>$href</code></li>
          <li><code>http-version</code> is the version of HTTP to use. It must be either the
            string <code>1.0</code> or <code>1.1</code>. Default is implementation-defined.  An
            implementation SHOULD support both and the default SHOULD be
            <code>1.1</code>. If the value specified is not supported by a specific implementation,
            it should throw an appropriate error message <a href="#dfn-errHC007">err:HC007</a>.</li>
          <li><code>status-only</code> control how the response will look like; if it is true, only
            the status code and the headers are returned, the content is not (no http:body nor
            http:multipart, nor the interpreted additional value in the returned sequence, see
            hereafter).</li>
          <li><code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>auth-method</code>
            and <code>send-authorization</code> are used for authentication (see section
            below).</li>
          <li><code>override-media-type</code> is a MIME type.  It can be used only with
            <code>http:request</code>, and will override the Content-Type header returned by the
            server.</li>
          <li><code>follow-redirect</code> control whether an HTTP redirect is automatically
            followed or not.  If it is false, the HTTP redirect is returned as the response.  If it
            is true (the default) the function tries to follow the redirect, by sending the same
            request to the new address (including body, headers, and authentication credentials).
            Maximum one redirect is followed (there is no attempt to follow a redirect in response
            to following a first redirect).</li>
          <li><code>timeout</code> is the maximum number of seconds to wait for the server to
            respond. If this time duration is reached, an error is thrown
            <a href="#dfn-errHC006">err:HC006</a>.</li>
          <li><code>http:header</code> represent an HTTP header, either in the
            <code>http:request</code> or in the <code>http:response</code> elements, as defined
            below.</li>
          <li><code>http:multipart</code> represents a multi-part body, either in a request or a
            response, as defined below.</li>
          <li><code>http:body</code> represents the body, either of a request or a response, as
            defined below.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <code>http:header</code> element represents an HTTP header, either in a request or in
          a response:</p>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:header name = string
             value = string>
   &lt;!-- Content: empty -->
&lt;/http:header></pre>
          </div>
        <p>The <code>http:body</code> element represents the body of either an HTTP request or of an
          HTTP response (in multipart requests and responses, it represents the body of a single one
          part):</p>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:body media-type = string
           src? = uri
           method? = "xml" | "html" | "xhtml" | "text" | "binary"
             | qname-but-not-ncname

           cdata-section-elements? = qnames
           doctype-public? = string
           doctype-system? = string
           encoding? = string
           escape-uri-attributes? = "yes" | "no"
           indent? = "yes" | "no"
           normalization-form? = "NFC" | "NFD" | "NFKC" | "NFKD"
             | "fully-normalized" | "none" | nmtoken

           standalone? = "yes" | "no" | "omit"
           suppress-indentation? = qnames
           undeclare-prefixes? = "yes" | "no"
           version? = nmtoken>
   &lt;!-- Content: any* -->
&lt;/http:body></pre>
          </div>
        <p>The <code>media-type</code> is the MIME media type of the body part. It is mandatory.  In
          a request it is given by the user and is the default value of the Content-Type header if
          it is not set explicitly. In a response, it is given by the implementation from the
          Content-Type header returned by the server. The <code>src</code> attribute can be used in
          a request to set the body content as the content of the linked resource instead of using
          the children of the <code>http:body</code> element. When this attribute is used, only
          the <code>media-type</code> attribute must also be present, and there can be neither
          content in the <code>http:body</code> element, nor any other attribute, or this is an
          error <a href="#dfn-errHC004">err:HC004</a>.</p>
        <p>All the attributes, except <code>src</code>, are used to set the corresponding
          serialization parameter defined in [[!xslt-xquery-serialization]], as defined for the
          XPath 3.0 function <code>fn:serialize()</code> [[!xpath-functions-30]]. Those attributes
          can be given by the user on a request to control the way a part body is serialized. In the
          response, the implementation can, but is not required, to provide some of them if it has
          the corresponding information (some of them do not make any sense in a response, therefore
          they will never be on a response element, for instance <code>version</code>).</p>
        <p>The <code>http:multipart</code> element represents an HTTP multi-part request or
          response:</p>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:multipart media-type = string
                boundary? = string>
   &lt;!-- (http:header*, http:body)+ -->
&lt;/http:multipart></pre>
        </div>
        <p>The <code>media-type</code> attribute is the media type of the whole request or response,
          and has to be a multipart media type (that is, its main type must be
          <code>multipart</code>). The <code>boundary</code> attribute is the boundary marker used
          to separate the several parts in the message (the value of the attribute is prefixed with
          "<code>--</code>" to form the actual boundary marker in the request; on the other way,
          this prefix is removed from the boundary marker in the response to set the value of the
          attribute).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Serializing the request content</h3>
        <p>If the request can have content (one body or several body parts), it can be specified by
          the <code>http:multipart</code> element, the <code>http:body</code> element, and/or the
          parameter <code>$bodies</code>. For each body, the content of the HTTP body is generated
          as follow.</p>
        <p>Except when its attribute <code>src</code> is present, a <code>http:request</code>
          element can have several attributes representing serialization parameters, as defined in
          [[!xslt-xquery-serialization]]. This spec defines in addition the method
          <code>'binary'</code>; in this case the body content must be either an xs:hexBinary or an
          xs:base64Binary item, and no other serialization parameter can be set
          besides <code>media-type</code>.</p>
        <p>The default value of the serialization method depends on the <code>media-type</code>: it
          is <code>'xml'</code> if it is an XML media type, <code>'html'</code> if it is an HTML
          media type, <code>'xhtml'</code> if it is <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
          <code>'text'</code> if it is a textual media type, and <code>'binary'</code> for any other
          case.</p>
        <p>When a body element has an empty content (i.e. it has no child node at all) its content
          is given by the parameter <code>$bodies</code>. In a single part request, this param must
          have at most one item. If the body is empty, the param cannot be the empty sequence. In a
          multipart request, <code>$bodies</code> must have as many items as there are empty body
          elements. If there are three empty body elements, the content of the first of them
          is <code>$bodies[1]</code>, and so on. The number of empty body elements must be equal to
          the number of items in <code>$bodies</code>.</p>

        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>HTTP authentication when sending a request is controlled by the attributes 
          <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>auth-method</code> and
          <code>send-authorization</code> on the element <code>http:request</code>.
          If <code>username</code> has a value, <code>password</code> and
          <code>auth-method</code> must have a value too.  And if any one of the three other
          attributes have been set, <code>username</code> must be set too.</p>
        <p>The attribute <code>auth-method</code> can be either <code>"Basic"</code> or
          <code>"Digest"</code>, but other values can also be used, in an implementation-defined
          way.  The handling of those attributes must be done in conformance to [[!rfc2617]].
          If <code>send-authorization</code> is true (default value is false) and the authentication
          method supports generating the header <code>Authorization</code> without challenge, the
          request contains this header.  The default value is to send a non-authenticated request,
          and if the response is an authentication challenge, then only send the credentials in a
          second message.</p>

      <h2>Dealing with the response</h2>
      <p>After having sent the request to the HTTP server, the function waits for the response.
        It analyses it and returns a sequence representing this response.  This sequence has
        an <code>http:response</code> element as first item, which is followed be an additional
        item for each body or body part in the response.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>The result element</h3>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:response status = integer
               message = string>
   &lt;!-- Content: (http:header*, (http:body|http:multipart)?) -->
&lt;/http:response></pre>
        </div>
        <p>This is the first item returned by the function defined in this module.
          The <code>status</code> attribute is the HTTP status code returned by the server,
          and <code>message</code> is the message coming with the status on the status line.
          The <code>http:header</code> elements are as defined for the request, but represent
          instead the response headers.  The <code>http:body</code>
          and <code>http:multipart</code> elements are also like in the request, but
          <code>http:body</code> elements must be empty.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Representing the result content</h3>
        <p>Instead of being inserted within the <code>http:response</code> element, the content of
          each body is returned as a single item in the return sequence.  Each item is in the same
          order (after the <code>http:response</code> element) than the <code>http:body</code>
          elements.  For each body, the way this item is built from the HTTP response is as
          follow.</p>
        <p>If the <code>status-only</code> attribute has the value <code>true</code> (default
          is <code>false</code>), the returned sequence will only contain the
          <code>http:response</code> element (with the headers, but also the empty
          <code>http:body</code> or <code>http:multipart</code> elements, as if
          <code>status-only</code> was false), and the following items, representing the bodies
          content are not generated from the HTTP response.</p>
        <p>For each body that has to be interpreted, the following rules apply in order to build the
          corresponding item.  If the body media type is a text media type, the item is a string,
          containing the body content.  If the media type is an XML media type, the content is
          parsed and the item is the resulting document node.  If the media type is an HTML type,
          the content is <emph>tidied up</emph> and parsed (this process is
          implementation-dependant) and the item is the resulting document node.  If this is a
          binary media type, the content is returned as a base64Binary item.  From the previous
          rules, a result item can then be either a document node (from XML or HTML), a string or a
          base64Binary.</p>
        <p>When the type of a part is either XML or HTML, its body has to be parsed into a document
          node. If there is any error when parsing the content, an error is raised with an
          appropriate message <a href="#dfn-errHC002">err:HC002</a>.</p>
        <p>If the attribute <code>override-media-type</code> is set on the request, its value is
          used instead of the Content-Type returned by the HTTP server. If the Content-Type of the
          response is a multipart type, the value of <code>override-media-type</code> can only be a
          multipart type, or <code>application/octet-stream</code> (to get the raw entity as a
          binary item). If it is not, this is an error <a href="#dfn-errHC003">err:HC003</a>.</p>

      <h2>Content types handling</h2>
      <p>In both requests and responses, MIME type strings are used to choose the way the entity
        content has to be respectively serialized or parsed.  Four different kinds of type are
        defined here, which are used in the above text about sending request and receiving response.
        The intent is to provide the spirit of the entity content handling regarding its content
        type, but an implementation is encouraged to deviate from those rules if it is obvious that
        a particular type should be treated in a specific way (normally, that would be the case only
        to treat a binary type as another type).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An XML media type has a MIME type of <code>text/xml</code>,
          <code>application/xml</code>, <code>text/xml-external-parsed-entity</code>,
          or <code>application/xml-external-parsed-entity</code>, as defined in [[!rfc3023]] (except
          that <code>application/xml-dtd</code> is considered a text media type).  MIME types ending
          by <code>+xml</code> are also XML media types.</li>
        <li>An HTML media type has a MIME type of <code>text/html</code>.</li>
        <li>Text media types are the remaining types beginning with <code>text/</code>.</li>
        <li>Binary types are all the other types.  An implementation can treat some of those binary
          types as either an XML, HTML or text media type if it is more appropriate (this is
          implementation-defined).</li>
      </ul>
