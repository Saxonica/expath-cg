      <p>
        This specification defines an HTTP client interface for XPath based
        languages. The HTTP client interface is provided through a single
        extension function which performs HTTP requests, and associated
        error codes which define client error states.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been designed to be compatible via [[!XPATH20]] with
        [[!XQUERY]], and [[!XSLT20]]. It should also be suitable
        for any other language which hosts XPath 2.0, such as [[!XPROC]].

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section>
	<h3>Namespace conventions</h3>
        <p>The module defined by this document defines one function in the namespace
          <code>http://expath.org/ns/http-client</code>. In this document, the
          <code>http</code> prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.</p>
        <p>Error codes are defined in the namespace <code>http://expath.org/ns/error</code>. In this
          document, the <code>err</code> prefix, when used, is bound to this namespace URI.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Error management</h3>
        <p>Error conditions are identified by a code (a <code>QName</code>). When such an error
          condition is reached during the execution of the function, a dynamic error is thrown, with
          the corresponding error code (as if the standard XPath function
          <a data-cite="xpath-functions#func-error">fn:error</a> had been called).</p>
        <p>There are many cases where the
          HTTP protocol layer may raise an error. In each case, if the error condition is not
          mentioned explicitly in the spec, the implementation MUST raise an error with the
          error code <a>err:HC001</a>.</p>

      <h2>The <dfn>http:send-request</dfn> function</h2>
      <p>This module defines an XPath extension function that sends an HTTP request and returns the
        corresponding response. It also supports HTTP multi-part messages. Here is the signature of this
        function:</p>
      <div class="proto">
        <table class="proto">
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="3"><code class="function">http:send-request</code>(</td>
              <td><code class="arg">$request</code></td>
              <td><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">element(http:request)?</code>,</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="arg">$href</code></td>
              <td><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">xs:string?</code>,</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code class="arg">$bodies</code></td>
              <td><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">item()*</code>)<code class="as"> as </code><code class="return-type">item()+</code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><code>$request</code> contains the various parameters of the request, for instance the
          HTTP method to use or the HTTP headers. Among other things, it can also contain the other
          parameters' values: the URI and the body(s). If they are not set as parameters to the function,
          their value in <code>$request</code>, if any, is used instead. See the <a href="#request-element" class="sectionRef"></a> for the
          definition of the <a>http:request</a> element. If the parameter does not follow the
          grammar defined in this spec, the error <a>err:HC005</a> MUST be raised.</li>
        <li><code>$href</code> is the HTTP or HTTPS URI to send the request to. It is an <code>xs:anyURI</code>,
          but is declared as an xs:string so that literal strings may be used; in other words, the parameter does not
          need to be explicitly cast as <code>xs:anyURI</code>).</li>
        <li><code>$bodies</code> is the request body content, for HTTP methods that can contain a
          body in the request (e.g. POST). It is an error if this parameter is not the empty sequence
          for methods that must be empty (e.g. DELETE). The details of the methods are defined in
          their respective specifications (e.g. [[!rfc2616]] or [[!rfc4918]]). In case of a multipart
          request, it can be a sequence of several items, each one is the body of the corresponding
          body descriptor in
          <code>$request</code>; see <a>http:multipart</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides the arity-three signature above, there are two other signatures that are convenient
        shortcuts (corresponding to the full version in which corresponding parameters have been set
        to the empty sequence). They are:</p>
      <div class="proto">
        <code class="function">http:send-request</code>(<code class="arg">$request</code><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">element(http:request)?</code>, <code class="arg">$href</code><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">xs:string?</code>) as <code class="return-type">item()+</code>
      </div>
      <div class="proto">
        <code class="function">http:send-request</code>(<code class="arg">$request</code><code class="as"> as </code><code class="type">element(http:request)?</code>, <code class="arg">$href</code>) as <code class="return-type">item()+</code>
      </div>

      <h2>Sending a request</h2>
      <p>The functions defined in this module allow the transmission of a request to an HTTP server and
        the reception of the corresponding response. The request is represented by the
        parameters to the function, which define how to generate the actual HTTP request to
        transmit.</p>

      <section id="request-element">
        <h3>The Request Element</h3>
        <p>The <dfn><code>http:request</code></dfn> element represents all the information needed to send the
          HTTP request.</p>
        <p>Some of the values defined for the <a>http:request</a> element can instead be set through
          a parameter to the function. For instance, some signatures define the
          parameter <code>$href</code>.  If the value of this parameter is not the empty sequence,
          it will override the value of the attribute <code>href</code> on
          the <code>http:request</code> element.</p>

        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:request method = ncname
              href? = uri
              http-version? = string
              status-only? = boolean
              username? = string
              password? = string
              auth-method? = string
              send-authorization? = boolean
              override-media-type? = string

   &lt;!-- Content: (http:header*, (http:body|http:multipart)?) -->
&lt;/http:request></pre>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li><code>method</code> is the <a data-cite="rfc1945#section-8">HTTP method</a>
            to use, e.g.: <code>GET</code>, <code>HEAD</code>, <code>POST</code>, etc. It is case insensitive</li>
          <li><code>href</code> is the URI that the request is made to. It can be overridden by
            the parameter <code>$href</code></li>
          <li><code>http-version</code> is the version of HTTP to use. It must be either the
            string <code>1.0</code> or <code>1.1</code>. Default is implementation-defined.  An
            implementation SHOULD support both and the default SHOULD be
            <code>1.1</code>. If the value specified is not supported by a specific implementation,
            it MUST throw the error <a>err:HC007</a>.</li>
          <li><code>status-only</code> controls how the response will be parsed; if it is true, only
            the status code and the headers are returned, and the content is omitted (no <a>http:body</a>, nor
            <a>http:multipart</a>, nor the interpreted additional value in the returned sequence).</li>
          <li><code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>auth-method</code>
            and <code>send-authorization</code> are used for authentication (see <a href="#authentication" class="sectionRef"></a>).</li>
          <li><code>override-media-type</code> is a Media Type ([[rfc6838]]).  It can be used only with
            <a>http:request</a>, and will override the <code>Content-Type</code>
            header in the HTTP Response returned by the server.</li>
          <li><code>follow-redirect</code> controls whether an HTTP redirect is automatically
            followed or not.  If it is <code>false</code>, the HTTP redirect is returned as the response.  If it
            is <code>true</code> (the default) the function tries to follow the redirect, by sending the same
            request to the new address (including body, headers, and authentication credentials).
            Maximum one redirect is followed (there is no attempt to follow a redirect in response
            to following a first redirect).</li>
          <li><code>timeout</code> is the maximum number of seconds to wait for the server to
            respond. If this time duration is exceeded, the error <a>err:HC006</a> MUST be raised.</li>
          <li><a><code>http:header</code></a> represents an HTTP header, either in the
            <a>http:request</a> or in the <a>http:response</a> elements.</li>
          <li><a><code>http:multipart</code></a> represents a multi-part body, either in a request or a
            response.</li>
          <li><a><code>http:body</code></a> represents the body, either of a request or a response.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <dfn><code>http:header</code></dfn> element represents an HTTP header, either in a request or
          a response:</p>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:header name = string

   &lt;!-- Content: empty -->
&lt;/http:header></pre>
          </div>
        <p>The <dfn><code>http:body</code></dfn> element represents the body of either an HTTP request or an
          HTTP response (in multipart requests and responses, it represents the body of a single
          part):</p>
        <div class="proto">

   &lt;!-- Content: any* -->
&lt;/http:body></pre>
          </div>
        <p>The <code>media-type</code> is the media type of the body part. It is mandatory. In
          a request it is provided by the user and is the default value of the <code>Content-Type</code> header if
          it is not set explicitly. In a response, it is provided by the implementation from the
          <code>Content-Type</code> header returned by the server. The <code>src</code> attribute can be used in
          a request to set the body content as the content of the linked resource instead of using
          the children of the <a>http:body</a> element. When this attribute is used, only
          the <code>media-type</code> attribute must also be present, and there can be neither
          content in the <code>http:body</code> element, nor any other attribute, otherwise the
          error <a>err:HC004</a> MUST be raised.</p>
        <p>All the attributes, except <code>src</code>, are used to set the corresponding
          serialization parameters defined in [[!xslt-xquery-serialization]]. Those attributes
          can be provided by the user on a request to control the way a part body is serialized. In the
          response, the implementation can, but is not required, to provide some of them if it has
          the corresponding information (some of them do not make any sense in a response, therefore
          they will never be supplied on the response element, for instance <code>version</code>).</p>
        <p>The <dfn><code>http:multipart</code></dfn> element represents an HTTP <a data-cite="rfc1945#section-3.6.2">Multipart Type</a> request or
          response:</p>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:multipart media-type = string
                boundary? = string>
   &lt;!-- (http:header*, http:body)+ -->
&lt;/http:multipart></pre>
        </div>
        <p>The <code>media-type</code> attribute is the media type of the whole request or response,
          and has to be a multipart media type (that is, its main type must be
          <code>multipart</code>). The <code>boundary</code> attribute is the boundary marker used
          to separate the several parts in the message (the value of the attribute is prefixed with
          "<code>--</code>" to form the actual boundary marker in the request; conversely,
          this prefix is removed from the boundary marker in the response to set the value of the
          attribute).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Serializing the Request</h3>
        <p>If the request entity body has content (one body or several body parts), it can be specified by
          the <a>http:multipart</a> element, the <a>http:body</a> element, and/or the
          parameter <code>$bodies</code>. For each body, the content of the HTTP body is generated
          as follows.</p>
        <p>Except when its attribute <code>src</code> is present, a <a>http:request</a>
          element can have several attributes representing serialization parameters, as defined in
          [[!xslt-xquery-serialization]]. This spec defines in addition the method
          <code>binary</code>; in this case the body content must be either an <code>xs:hexBinary</code> or an
          <code>xs:base64Binary</code> item, and no other serialization parameter can be set
          besides <code>media-type</code>.</p>
        <p>The default value of the serialization method depends on the <code>media-type</code>: it
          is <code>xml</code> if it is an XML media type, <code>html</code> if it is an HTML
          media type, <code>xhtml</code> if it is <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
          <code>text</code> if it is a textual media type, and <code>binary</code> for any other
          case.</p>
        <p>When a body element has no content (i.e. no child nodes) its content
          is given by the parameter <code>$bodies</code>. In a single part request, this parameter must
          have at most one item. If the body is empty, the parameter cannot be the empty sequence. In a
          multipart request, <code>$bodies</code> must have as many items as there are empty body
          elements. If there are three empty body elements, the content of the first of them
          is <code>$bodies[1]</code>, and so on. The number of empty body elements must be equal to
          the number of items in <code>$bodies</code>.</p>

        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>HTTP authentication when sending a request is controlled by the attributes 
          <code>username</code>, <code>password</code>, <code>auth-method</code> and
          <code>send-authorization</code> on the <a>http:request</a> element.
          If <code>username</code> has a value, <code>password</code> and
          <code>auth-method</code> must have a value too.  And if any one of the three other
          attributes have been set, <code>username</code> must be set too.</p>
        <p>The attribute <code>auth-method</code> can be either <code>Basic</code> or
          <code>Digest</code>, but other values can also be used, in an implementation-defined
          way. The handling of those attributes must be done in conformance with [[!rfc2617]].
          If <code>send-authorization</code> is <code>true</code> (default value is <code>false</code>) and the authentication
          method supports generating the header <code>Authorization</code> without challenge, the
          request contains this header. The default value is to send a non-authenticated request,
          and if the response is an authentication challenge, only then send the credentials in a
          second request.</p>

      <h2>Handling the Response</h2>
      <p>After having sent the request to the HTTP server, the function waits for the response.
        The HTTP client parses the raw response and the function returns a representation of the
        response as a sequence. The sequence has
        an <a>http:response</a> element as the first item, which is followed by an additional
        item for each body or body part in the response.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>The Response Element</h3>
        <div class="proto">
          <pre>
&lt;http:response status = integer
               message = string>
   &lt;!-- Content: (http:header*, (http:body|http:multipart)?) -->
&lt;/http:response></pre>
        </div>
        <p>The <dfn>http:response</dfn> element is the first item in the sequence returned by the function.
          The <code>status</code> attribute is the HTTP <a data-cite="rfc1945#section-6.1.1">Status Code</a> returned by the server,
          and <code>message</code> is the Reason Phrase coming with the <a data-cite="rfc1945#section-6.1">Status-Line</a>.
          The <code>http:header</code> elements are as defined for the request, but represent
          instead the response headers. The <a>http:body</a>
          and <a>http:multipart</a> elements are also like in the request, but
          <code>http:body</code> elements must be empty.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>The Response Entity Body</h3>
        <p>Instead of being inserted within the <a>http:response</a> element, the content of
          each body is returned as a single item in the returned sequence. Each item is in the same
          order (after the <a>http:response</a> element) as the <a>http:body</a>
          elements. For each body, the way this item is built from the HTTP response is as
          follow.</p>
        <p>If the <code>status-only</code> attribute has the value <code>true</code> (default
          is <code>false</code>), the returned sequence will only contain the
          <a>http:response</a> element (with the headers, but also the empty
          <a>http:body</a> or <a>http:multipart</a> elements, as if
          <code>status-only</code> was <code>false</code>), and the following items, representing the bodies
          content are not generated from the HTTP response.</p>
        <p>For each body that has to be parsed, the following rules apply in order to build the
          corresponding XDM item. If the body media type is a text media type, the item is an <code>xs:string</code>,
          containing the body content. If the media type is an XML media type, the content is
          parsed and the item is the resulting XDM <code>document-node</code>. If the media type is an HTML type,
          the content is <emph>tidied up</emph> and parsed (this process is
          both implementation-dependent and implementation-defined) and the item is the resulting XDM <code>document-node</code>.  If this is a
          binary media type, the content is returned as an <code>xs:base64Binary</code> item.  From the previous
          rules, a result item can then be either a <code>document-node</code> (from XML or HTML), an <code>xs:string</code>, or a
          <code>xs:base64Binary</code>.</p>
        <p>When the type of a part is either XML or HTML, its body has to be parsed into a document
          node. If an error occurs whilst parsing the content, the error <a>err:HC002</a> MUST be raised.</p>
        <p>If the attribute <code>override-media-type</code> is set on the request, its value is
          used instead of the <code>Content-Type</code> header returned by the HTTP server. If the <code>Content-Type</code> header of the
          response indicates a multipart type, the value of <code>override-media-type</code> can only be a
          multipart type, or <code>application/octet-stream</code> (to get the raw entity as a
          binary item). If it is not, the error <a>err:HC003</a> MUST be raised.</p>

      <h2>Processing Media Types</h2>
      <p>In both requests and responses, Media Type strings are used to choose the way the entity
        content has to be serialized or parsed.</p>
      <p>We define four different classes of Media Type, which are used for sending requests and receiving responses.
        The intent is to provide guidance as to handling the entity content with respect to its content
        type, but an implementation is permitted to deviate from those rules if it is obvious that
        a particular type should be treated in a specific way, typically this can be useful for binary types such as [[EXI]].</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For XML the following media types are appropriate: <code>text/xml</code>,
          <code>application/xml</code>, <code>text/xml-external-parsed-entity</code>,
          or <code>application/xml-external-parsed-entity</code>, as defined in [[!rfc3023]] (except
          that <code>application/xml-dtd</code> is considered a text media type). Media types ending
          with <code>+xml</code> are also considered XML types.</li>
        <li>For HTML the media type <code>text/html</code> is suggested.</li>
        <li>For Text, a media type beginning with <code>text/</code> is suggested.</li>
        <li>All other media types are treated as binary. An implementation MAY treat some of those binary
          types as either an XML, HTML or text media type if it is more appropriate (this is
          implementation-defined).</li>
      </ul>
